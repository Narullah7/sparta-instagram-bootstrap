# Brief

I created this html page by first using the grids layout to get the overall layout of how everything was going to be placed on the page. I then proceeded to fill in each if the individual grids i.e. if it included an image or it was the footer.

# Difficulties

* While all other aspects of the webpage were responsive, the image of the IPhones would not be and after much research and tutorials, i could not get the image to be responsive.

* setting the individual width and height of the containers.

# Most pleased width

* i am pleased with the overall layout of the page. using the grid system really helped.

*  I am also pleased with the responsiveness of the main text containers and footers.

* I like how the webpage looks much better than my previous attempt, it looks much more professional, and I managed to complete it quicker.
